// Create Human Object

// Use IIFE to get human data from form

// Create Dino Compare Method 1
// NOTE: Weight in JSON file is in lbs, height in inches.

// Create Dino Compare Method 2
// NOTE: Weight in JSON file is in lbs, height in inches.

// Create Dino Compare Method 3
// NOTE: Weight in JSON file is in lbs, height in inches.

// Generate Tiles for each Dino in Array

// Add tiles to DOM

// Remove form from screen
